# EDA with red wine quality data

Data Set Information:

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

Attribute Information:
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity 2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid 4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides 6 - free sulfur dioxide 7 - total sulfur dioxide 8 - density 9 - pH 10 - sulphates 11 - alcohol Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)



## What is EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data science method that helps you understand data sets by looking for patterns, outliers, and relationships. It's often the first step in data analysis.

## What EDA does?

Helps you understand the data set's variables and how they relate to each other
Helps you identify anomalies and outliers
Helps you test hypotheses and check assumptions
Helps you determine if statistical techniques are appropriate

## How EDA works?

Uses data visualization methods like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns and trends 
Uses correlation analysis to determine the relationship between variables 

## Steps in EDA?

Understand the data set
Clean the data
Transform the data
Integrate the data
Explore the data
Visualize the data
Use descriptive statistics
